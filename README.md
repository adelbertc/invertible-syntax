# invertible-syntax

With Invertible Syntax, you write a description of your language similar to parser combinators, and then can you use that same description to parse or to pretty-print. The results are guaranteed to be (partially) isomorphic by construction.

Inspired by Haskell's [invertible-syntax](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/invertible-syntax) and [partial-isomorphisms](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/partial-isomorphisms).
